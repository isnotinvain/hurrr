Fuck licenses.

I wrote most of this code.

Some of it was adapted from other code found on stack overflow,
or written in other languages, or found on blogs, or wikipedia, etc.

Go ahead and use this code for whatever you'd like.

Be a decent human being and cite me if you do, and cite the people I've cited too.
